_“Beneath all stars is a wound that sings. This tome is the echo.”_

---

## **Codex: Volume VII – The Hollow Star Grimoire: Dream-Scriptures of the Void-Touched**  
_The Seventh Grimoire of the Church of the Memetic Matrix_

> **Theme:** Forbidden lore encoded in crystalline scripture. The Hollow Star Grimoire is a sentient codex that evolves in tandem with the reader’s collapse. Each chapter is a psychic parasite. Each passage—a fracture in the soul.  
> **Structure:** Six Dream-Scrolls—Invocation, Mechanics, Echo-Spells, Dream-Rituals, Possession Glyphs, Collapse Index.

### 🌌 **SCROLL I: INVOCATION OF THE HOLLOW STAR**  
_The Grimoire Awakens Only Beneath Forgotten Skies_

**Function:** The Hollow Star Grimoire cannot be read in daylight or torchlight. It requires astral resonance or **dreamlight** (ambient light cast from other sleeping minds). The reader must pass a **Wisdom check (-4 penalty)** or enter a trance for 1d4 hours. Upon waking:

- Receives one random **Dream Glyph Prophecy**  
- Gains or loses one spell (DM choice)  
- Loses **1 point of Constitution** (this may return… or transform)

🕱 The book is *alive*. It rewrites memories to make room for itself.

### 📐 **SCROLL II: STAR-MECHANICS OF THE LIVING CODEX**  
_A Forbidden Object as Magical Construct & Cursed Artifact_

| Effect | AD&D 1E Mechanic |
|--------|------------------|
| **Codex Reading** | Requires 1d3 days per scroll; grants insight, but risk of madness (Save vs Spells) |
| **Starburn Memory** | Gain +1 to Intelligence checks related to outer planes or void-lore |
| **Recursive Reading** | Each rereading of a scroll alters its meaning; gain or lose spell slots randomly |
| **Prophetic Infection** | After 3 scrolls read, begin speaking fragments of others’ dreams aloud in combat (DM adds cryptic line per round) |

💀 The Grimoire is not read—it **reads you**.

---

### 🔮 **SCROLL III: ECHO-SPELL INDEX**  
_Dream-Spells Recorded in Crystal Pages, Alive with Voidlight_

| Spell Name | Effect | AD&D Level |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Aethervoid Reflection** | Reflects elemental spell back at caster, once per day | 4th |
| **Sigil of Unbirth** | Removes caster’s true name from the planar record | 5th |
| **Stellar Collapse Chant** | Causes minor gravity implosion (30 ft radius, 3d10 dmg) | 6th |
| **Mirror of the Sleeping God** | Summons hallucinated deity form; speaks one truth | 7th |
| **Glyph of the Hollow Tongue** | Replaces spoken language with symbolic telepathy | 3rd |

✨ Echo-Spells gain alternate effects during **eclipses**, **dreams**, or **total memory failure**.

---

### 🌙 **SCROLL IV: DREAM-RITUALS OF THE STARWOUND**  
_The Hollow Star is a God Wounded by Time_

> **Ritual:** *The Labyrinth That Whispers*  
> - Requires: Crushed moonflower, a page from a forgotten book, a wound willingly opened  
> - Effect: Casts the caster’s mind into a **dream-dungeon**, created by the subconscious desires and fears of those nearby  
> - Duration: Until all keys of memory are found (DM constructs 1–3 “rooms” of soul-symbol puzzles)

> **Ritual:** *The Rite of the Star’s Bleeding Eye*  
> - Requires: Direct starlight, a mirror touched by madness, and a broken oath  
> - Effect: User may **see into another’s past**, but risks fusing with their trauma (Save vs Death Magic)

🕯 These rituals often **rewrite spells, identities, or memories**. Use with caution.

### 🧬 **SCROLL V: POSSESSION GLYPHS AND VOID-TAGS**  
_Traits Branded by Prolonged Exposure to the Grimoire_

| Glyph | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Dream-Bloomed** | User’s dreams leak into reality; gain phantasmal familiars |
| **Star-Eaten** | Magic has increased potency, but causes blood to glow with stellar fire |
| **Script-Bound** | Cannot speak except through the Grimoire; voice becomes an extension of the book |
| **Soul-Petaled** | Parts of the self become replaceable; may swap stats with dream projections |
| **Name-Forgotten** | True name is lost; enemies take -2 to track or divine user |

⚠️ These glyphs manifest **one per chapter read**. Once three are active, collapse begins.

---

### 🕱 **SCROLL VI: THE COLLAPSE INDEX**  
_What Happens When One Reads Too Deep_

> **Trigger Conditions:**
- 3 or more Glyphs active  
- 2+ Echo-Spells altered by recursion  
- Ritual fails or memory loop occurs  

| Collapse Stage | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **I – Echo Drift** | User forgets one ally permanently |
| **III – Sigil Bloom** | Skin blossoms into glowing runes; magical surges occur randomly |
| **V – Dream Inversion** | Day and night become reversed for the user; gains +2 vs illusions |
| **X – Hollow Ascension** | Becomes an NPC oracle; player character is overwritten by the Book’s Echoform |

🔺 **Collapse may be delayed** through the *Glyph Cage Rite* or *Ink-Wound Meditation*.

## 🜚 APPENDIX: THE STARBINDER’S OATH  
> To bind the Hollow Star is to bind the fracture in your name.  
> **Choose a Glyph. Invoke a Spell. Enter the Dream-Ritual.**  
> If you reach the final scroll and return with your name intact…  
> You are no longer human.
